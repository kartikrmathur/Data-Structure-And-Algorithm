Static vs. Public
we created a static method, which means that it can be accessed without creating an object of the class,
unlike public, which can only be accessed by objects:
Remember:-
The dot (.) is used to access the object's attributes and methods.
To call a method in Java, write the method name followed by a set of parentheses (), followed by a semicolon (;).
A class must have a matching filename (Main and Main.java).

Constructor :-
A constructor in Java is a special method that is used to initialize objects.
The constructor is called when an object of a class is created.
It can be used to set initial values for object attributes

Note that the constructor name must match the class name, and it cannot have a return type (like void).
Also note that the constructor is called when the object is created.
All classes have constructors by default: if you do not create a class constructor yourself, Java creates one for you.
However, then you are not able to set initial values for object attributes.
